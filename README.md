This is **Dungeon Crawler** by *slopey112*, a WIP *command-line RPG game*.

To actually launch this game from the command line, you're going to have to access the .jar file in this project, located at */out/artifacts/Command_Line_RPG_jar/*.

There you'll find the .jar executable. In order to run it, I reccommend launching it straight from the command line as that is the sure-fire way of making sure it works. Simply enter the following code into the command line once you are at that directory:

```$xslt
java -jar Command\ Line\ RPG.jar/
```

And you'll be set! If you have any issues, just pull an issue here on Github. Have fun!
