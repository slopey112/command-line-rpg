This is **Dungeon Crawler** by *slopey112*, a WIP *command-line RPG game*.

###Installation

The developer of this game has been incredibly lazy to streamline the process yet, but here's a quick tutorial if you don't care about the source code.

1. Make an empty folder to store the game files. It's name doesn't matter.
2. Get the .jar file stored under */out/artifacts/Command+Line_RPG_jar/*, and move it to your folder.
3. Next, you'll want to download the *data.txt* and *highscores.txt* stored under the root directory of this repo. It should be right above this file. Move those in the folder as well.

That's it insofar as installation! Easy, right?

###Gameplay

As the name of this repo suggests, this is, of course, a command line utility. So let's set that up real quick.

1. Go on your terminal and naviagte to the folder you created earlier. 
2. Once you're inside the folder, enter the following command into the terminal:
```$xslt
java -jar Command\ Line\ RPG.jar
```
And the game will subsequently launch. 

That's pretty much it! If you find any bugs or issues, feel free to pull an issue here on GitHub. Have fun!
